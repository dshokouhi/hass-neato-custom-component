# Neato Custom Component For Home Assistant

This is a custom component designed for Home Assistant to test new Neato features.

Currently testing fixes for D7 firmware 4.3.1

Steps to install.

1. Create a `custom_components` folder in your home assistant configuration directory if it does not exist already
2. Download the code here and place all the files inside the `custom_components` folder.  Make sure that `neato.py` from the root of the project is directly inside the `custom_components` folder.  Make sure the 3 folders are also included.
3. Leave Neato configured as it is in your configuration.yaml (or configure it according to the docs: https://www.home-assistant.io/components/neato/)
4. Restart Home Assistant

Enjoy using your Botvac in Home Assistant!
